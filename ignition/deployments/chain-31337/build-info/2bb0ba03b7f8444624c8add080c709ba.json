This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```solidity\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}\n to enforce additional security measures for this role."

                "text": " @dev A vesting wallet is an ownable contract that can receive native currency and ERC-20 tokens, and release these\n assets to the wallet owner, also referred to as \"beneficiary\", according to a vesting schedule.\n Any assets transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as if they were locked from the beginning.\n Consequently, if the vesting has already started, any amount of tokens sent to this contract will (at least partly)\n be immediately releasable.\n By setting the duration to 0, one can configure this contract to behave like an asset timelock that holds tokens for\n a beneficiary until a specified time.\n NOTE: Since the wallet is {Ownable}, and ownership can be transferred, it is possible to sell unvested tokens.\n Preventing this in a smart contract is difficult, considering that: 1) a beneficiary address could be a\n counterfactually deployed contract, 2) there is likely to be a migration path for EOAs to become contracts in the\n near future.\n NOTE: When using this contract with any token whose balance is adjusted automatically (i.e. a rebase token), make\n sure to account the supply/balance adjustment in the vesting schedule to ensure the vested amount is as intended.\n NOTE: Chains with support for native ERC20s may allow the vesting wallet to withdraw the underlying asset as both an\n ERC20 and as native currency. For example, if chain C supports token A and the wallet gets deposited 100 A, then\n at 50% of the vesting period, the beneficiary can withdraw 50 A as ERC20 and 25 A as native currency (totaling 75 A).\n Consider disabling one of the withdrawal methods."

However, if\n the call reverted with no returned reason, this function reverts with a\n {Errors.FailedCall} error.\n Returns the raw returned data.

This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]."

This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules} to enforce additional security measures for this role.\",\"errors\":{\"AccessControlBadConfirmation()\":[{\"details\":\"The caller of a function is not the expected one.

Any assets transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as if they were locked from the beginning. Consequently, if the vesting has already started, any amount of tokens sent to this contract will (at least partly) be immediately releasable. By setting the duration to 0, one can configure this contract to behave like an asset timelock that holds tokens for a beneficiary until a specified time. NOTE: Since the wallet is {Ownable}, and ownership can be transferred, it is possible to sell unvested tokens. Preventing this in a smart contract is difficult, considering that: 1) a beneficiary address could be a counterfactually deployed contract, 2) there is likely to be a migration path for EOAs to become contracts in the near future. NOTE: When using this contract with any token whose balance is adjusted automatically (i.e. a rebase token), make sure to account the supply/balance adjustment in the vesting schedule to ensure the vested amount is as intended. NOTE: Chains with support for native ERC20s may allow the vesting wallet to withdraw the underlying asset as both an ERC20 and as native currency. For example, if chain C supports token A and the wallet gets deposited 100 A, then at 50% of the vesting period, the beneficiary can withdraw 50 A as ERC20 and 25 A as native currency (totaling 75 A). Consider disabling one of the withdrawal methods.\",\"errors\":{\"FailedCall()\":[{\"details\":\"A call to an address target failed.

Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/ExampleToken.sol\":\"ExampleToken\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":10000},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x1a6b4f6b7798ab80929d491b89d5427a9b3338c0fd1acd0ba325f69c6f1646af\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7bb7f346c12a14dc622bc105ce3c47202fbc89f4b153a28a63bb68193297330c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmagwF8P3bUBXwdo159ueEnY9dLSvEWwK24kk2op58egwG\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/IAccessControl.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xbff9f59c84e5337689161ce7641c0ef8e872d6a7536fbc1f5133f128887aba3c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b308f882e796f7b79c9502deacb0a62983035c6f6f4e962b319ba6a1f4a77d3d\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmaWCW7ahEQqFjwhSUhV7Ae7WhfNvzSpE7DQ58hvEooqPL\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x19fdfb0f3b89a230e7dbd1cf416f1a6b531a3ee5db4da483f946320fc74afc0e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3490d794728f5bfecb46820431adaff71ba374141545ec20b650bb60353fac23\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPsfxjVpMcZbpE7BH93DzTpEaktESigEw4SmDzkXuJ4WR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x86b7b71a6aedefdad89b607378eeab1dcc5389b9ea7d17346d08af01d7190994\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1dc2db8d94a21eac8efe03adf574c419b08536409b416057a2b5b95cb772c43c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZfqJCKVU1ScuX2A7s8WZdQEaikwJbDH5JBrBdKTUT4Gu\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x74ed01eb66b923d0d0cfe3be84604ac04b76482a55f9dd655e1ef4d367f95bc2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5282825a626cfe924e504274b864a652b0023591fa66f06a067b25b51ba9b303\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeCfPykghhMc81VJTrHTC7sF6CRvaA1FXVq2pJhwYp1dV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd6fa4088198f04eef10c5bce8a2f4d60554b7ec4b987f684393c01bf79b94d9f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f95ee0bbd4dd3ac730d066ba3e785ded4565e890dbec2fa7d3b9fe3bad9d0d6e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSLr6bHkPFWT7ntj34jmwfyskpwo97T9jZUrk5sz3sdtR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x2d9dc2fe26180f74c11c13663647d38e259e45f95eb88f57b61d2160b0109d3e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://81233d1f98060113d9922180bb0f14f8335856fe9f339134b09335e9f678c377\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmWh6R35SarhAn4z2wH8SU456jJSYL2FgucfTFgbHJJN4E\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8891738ffe910f0cf2da09566928589bf5d63f4524dd734fd9cedbac3274dd5c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://971f954442df5c2ef5b5ebf1eb245d7105d9fbacc7386ee5c796df1d45b21617\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmadRjHbkicwqwwh61raUEapaVEtaLMcYbQZWs9gUkgj3u\"]},\"contracts/ExampleToken.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x66143fbb4c2d4762ff31e54e847abdb58620d26f6a09412b1e0555ea42c70710\",\"license\":\"FSL-1.1-MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://9f47bdf8ba57b04931646165a5a9214d3a1022655928776f519d1b2d2ea90891\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmYCUzS9iciRarvQ7AxDBAZZDqagtLU3HZTh8bpHXP5hTB\"]}},\"version\":1}"
